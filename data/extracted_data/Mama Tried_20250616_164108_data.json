      "description": "+Rose Thomas Bannister- The long-awaited third album, and second vinyl release, by singer-songwriter Rose Thomas Bannister is finally here: The Little Wren.Adopted as a child and raised by militant Christians, Bannister was enticed from the Lord's army by a library copy ofA Coney Island of the Mindand escaped with her glove box stuffed with illicit \"secular music\" cassettes.Bannister's first record,A Cruel, Cruel Woman,was warm, twangy, and almost unknown. Her second,The Sewing Room,was a slow-blooming underground hit of subdued, mystical folk. Her new record,The Little Wren,is Bannister's most ambitious.Her highly specific biblical imagery takes on a darker edge than onThe Sewing Room,without  sacrificing pathos or wit. On the “B” side, she moves away from the Old  Testament with a song cycle based on Macbeth. She's focused obsessively  on familial betrayal and naturalistic symbols, experimenting with  shifting time signatures and tonal surprises.Bannister  has worked with a notably eclectic range of musicians and artists. This  record features a significant contribution from the late pedal steel  legend Susan Alcorn. Other collaborators and guests include Bob  Bannister, Pat Gubler, Debby Schwartz, Gary Foster, Concetta Abate,  Lenna Pierce, Charlie Rauh and Jessica Pavone.The  record was recorded and co-produced by Greg Talenfeld in OK Records in  Nyack, New York. Cover art is by the visionary Baltimore artist and  musician Liz Downing, with design by Alfra Martini.+Psychic Lines- Phil Jacob’s confusing melodies and musings with a good dose of sax, carried by bassist Dann Baker and drummer Nancy Polstein. Like Leonard Cohen leading Sonic Youth into Gerry Rafferty’s underwater lair. “There is something intensely cinematic in the way Psychic Lines sets the scene.” (Atwood Mag)+SWRM-"

      "description": "+The Scene is Now- formed in 1983 and remains active to the present day. While one critic described them as “NYC’s most criminally neglected band,” certainly they have not been denied critical praise. The New York Times extolled “the sort of zany humor one might expect to find in some netherworld between Tristan Tzara and Spike Jones. The instrumental juxtapositions are consistently surprising, often hilarious, but there is no novelty for novelty’s sake. Every sound has its place.” Their current lineup is Chris Nelson, vocals and guitar; Greg Peterson, guitar; Steven Levi, cornet; Cheryl Kingan, baritone sax; Bob Bannister, bass; and Blake Lindberg, drums.  Their forthcoming vinyl LPAfter Cadmuswill be released this year.+Corset Lore- Corset Lore serves up a cutting vision of dance-minded humanity hijacked and controlled by extraterrestrials on an asteroid. The songs themselves are infectiously hook-laden and give me earned body aches from hard dancing. Essential listening for anyone who digs synthpop, chiptune, artrock, or electronic dance music with dystopian subtext and depth. Imagine an alternate version of early Depeche Mode fronted by Kate Bush performing on the set of the 90s Total Recall but as a Nintendo game.+Voodini- a spiked punchbowl of sonic oddities, blending high-octane  surf, sleazy blues, and garage rock with a dash of Black Magic. A  distorted love letter to vintage jukebox tunes... they’re your mother’s  favorite rock ’n’ roll band."

Neither on the verge of exhausting their beat-thing metaphor, nor willing to squander their resources on a second CD, the duo eschews the popular notion of including a gratuitous \"guest artist\" in order to enhance their singular vision of a greener planet. \"An uncommon instrumental pairing, these seasoned downtown improvisors form an unusually stimulating duo\" -- The Wire."

The album, a fitting introduction to Jude’s seriously fun approach to pop, blends the enduring guitar rhythms of early Strokes with the earworm melodies of The Beach Boys. Jude is now based in Brooklyn and records under the mononym JUDE.+bear dog- is a new band led by Buffalo native Tim Henderson, joined by a rotating group of childhood friends. Influenced by classic singer-songwriter and soul music as well as high school favorites Alex Turner and Hamilton Leithauser, bear dog blends soulful heartland vocals with catchy indie rock melodies. bear dog's upcoming single \"in the morning in the evening\" is Henderson's first release since \"Used Cars\" with Timothy Alice & the Dead Star Band.+Domestic Drafts- is the songwriting project of Andy Cush, who can otherwise be found playing bass and singing in Garcia Peoples. 'Only the Singer,' the band's debut album, was released on Glamour Gowns Records in 2025. Taking cues from the likes of Neil Young, Bill Callahan, and Richard Thompson, his songs blend melancholy and wry humor, destined for soundtracking half-remembered evenings in cozy locales, mingling with the scent of beer and cigarettes."

      "description": "Live Band Karaoke! - karaoke but backed by a live band.This documentis a way to sign up to participate.You  are welcome to sign up in any open box. Please don't erase someone  else's name and put your own in! Also please be thoughtful about not  signing up for too many slots, especially singing slots (no more than 2  singing slots per person, please!).We'll  have time to do ~30 songs all told, and so ideally that means we'll  have everything figured out ahead of time. It's important to know who's  playing what instruments ahead of time particularly so people can get a  chance to go over the song on their own (in the past when we've done  this, there hasn't been any rehearsal beforehand the day of the event).One difference between this and machine karaoke is that we need to make  charts for the band for each song. Some of the songs on this list  already have charts, others we might only make a chart for if it seems  like a band is going to come together to play it. You can add songs to  this list that you don't see here, but keep in mind it will need a chart  as well as players to actually happen. Grabbing the chords off a guitar  tab site is a dicey proposition, they're often lacking information or  have wrong information. We like a high information, concise, clear  chart! We'll have iPads to read the charts off of.Songs  don't have to happen at karaoke exactly in their original form. If you  want to do something in a slower tempo or different key etc, you can  make a note of it. Making a whole new arrangement that's different from  the recorded version is hard to do sans rehearsal and not recommended.  We'll defer to the singer of the song for basic decisions, but keep in  mind that a band might not be able to change what key the song is in on  the fly. Planning ahead is best!"

The sounds might be a bit dusty (as the kids say) but the heart is full of love and lust (in the dust!) Ladies and Gentlemen. We’re all Diceholes.+Bull Thieves-Formed in Brooklyn in 2009 by three Texas ex-pats (Lance Scott Walker, Birdlikebats, and Nicholas Phelps), Bull Thieves played shows around NYC and released one self-titled album before going underground in 2011. As Walker pivoted to work on his books about Houston hip-hop (Houston Rap Tapes, DJ Screw: A Life In Slow Revolution) and the other band members relocated, they continued to collaborate on new material from afar. In 2024, Walker fully rebooted the band — this time with his best friend, the artist Joan LeMay (Quantum Criminals: Ramblers, Wild Gamblers, and Other Sole Survivors From the Songs of Steely Dan) playing bass and sharing vocal/writing duties. As the core duo of a larger collective that includes the original Bull Thieves as well as Houston producers Stenographer and JGtheengineer, Walker and LeMay play a noisy grade of indie rock that descends from the Texas punk they grew up on, with threads of shoegaze and the rap and jazz/funk/R&B back catalogues that have informed their work as writer and artist. Bull Thieves released the 7-inch \"Pasture Kills\" b/w \"Wild Own\" in May 2025, and an album is coming this summer.+Gladys-Subversive songs about seltzer. With a hint of psychedelia. Exceptional trousers courtesy of the bass player."

They've been actively playing in New York scenes since 2019. While the band’s roots are in dreampop, they draw inspiration from a variety of musical influences including jazz, shoegaze, R&B, and post-punk.+Hilbert’s Hotel- is a thought experiment that demonstrates that a fully occupied hotel with infinitely many rooms may still accommodate additional guests. Similarly, this band demonstrates that it could theoretically play for an infinite number of fans and accommodate an infinite quantity of musicians and musical forms. Hilbert’s Hotel (or Motel, depending on the venue) plays mostly original music, mostly about Love, in a genre of their own making, American Folk Kora, without reservation. Come and bring infinite friends.+Cholo-is the brainchild of singer/songwriter/saxophonist Felipe Flores. CHOLO is an ode to the ugly beauty of the indigenousness of Peru. Through the lens of an immigrant child born and raised 'on' the south shore of Long Island, New York, filtered through the post-punk, indie, avant-noise, blah blah music that influenced him, CHOLO is a sonic champion for the underdog, the loner, the lover, the misfit toy, the person that doesn't quite belong.CHOLO's early years had substantial contributions from past members Rosa, Dave, Gary, and Mike. After a long hiatus, CHOLO was resurrected by a stellar lineup of Jessica (El Jezel, Chromoplast), Ryan(Sotto Voce), Isabel (Jupiter Boys), and Matt (Jupiter Boys, Human Hearts, Palomar).
