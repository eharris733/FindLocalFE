From headlining The Kerrville Folk Fest, Philadelphia Folk Fest, Black Bear Americana Fest.

He’s played with Suzanne Vega, Dar Williams, David Francey, John McCutcheon, John Gorka, Judy Collins and 100s more. His songs have been made into award winning films.      In concert, he is funny as hell one moment and transcendent the next. HE BELIEVES IN STORIES. Come to a show.  Visual, artful and surprising.     Brooklyn in July, Oklahoma towns, rattlesnake tails, turbary thieves, meter maids and drunk roosters. At the end of the night, you’ll leave inspired.       “The Long Note” is a phrase in Irish culture. “The Long Note” is that place of resonance and transcendence where the music, the voices, the instruments, and the community ALL come together and unite.

He lives in Ithaca NY, and tours regularly in the US, Ireland and Canada.       WWW.JOECROOKSTON.COM   Selena Tibert  is an alternative folk artist and musician based in Brooklyn. Grounded in expertly crafted musical arrangements with a clear, rich vocal, her songs pulse with modern jazz and 70s folk influence. Lyrically, she treats personal and universal narratives with mythological reverence, best exemplified in each line of her latest record, The Fool.  Raised in ruggedly beautiful Camano Island, WA in the Pacific Northwest, Selena Tibert’s early life was colored with music and storytelling. Her parents, also musicians, raised her on genre classics like Carole King, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young. She’s brought her enigmatic songs to life across the country from Seattle and Portland to Boston and beyond, including storied NYC venues The Bowery Electric, Berlin, Rockwood Music Hall, and more.  In June of 2024, Selena Tibert released her debut EP,  The Fool . The record was produced, arranged, and engineered entirely by Tibert, whose other skill lies in sourcing exceptional talent to help bring her vision to life. The EP was mixed and mastered by Tom Gardner at Rift Studios in Brooklyn. In live performance, these songs are lifted from their recorded arrangements with careful precision, while allowing room for adept improvisation from Tibert’s band. Sonically, the record is both grounded and mercurial, evoking Marika Hackman and Anaïs Mitchell. “At the same time powerful and subtle, this voice expresses a full palette of emotions,” writes  Indiefferential .   Her two previous releases, singles “Where It’s Dark” and “Feels Like a Sin”, are impressive standalones. “Where It’s Dark”, Tibert’s first release and also self-produced, is darkly inviting, blending acoustic folk with gently synthesized vocal harmonies. Drawing comparisons to 70s rock storytellers Uriah Heep and legendary singer-songwriter Janis Ian,  The Other Side Reviews  writes: “The soothing, almost raw arrangement draws you into a spine-chilling melody; however, it is Tibert’s ethereal vocals that enhance a sense of intoxicating breathlessness to the haunting single.”   “Feels Like a Sin” acts thematically like sister-song to “Where It’s Dark”, but leans more heavily on the modern folk sounds of Laura Marling or Haley Heynderickx. Deftly addressing feelings of social anxiety, it’s a deeply personal song without being overly sentimental or self-deprecating; another testament to Tibert’s writing.   Selena Tibert has released sold out direct-to-vinyl sessions with Leesta Vall Sound Recordings in Brooklyn, and produced, arranged, and engineered the single “Sweet Thing” with fellow NYC folk duo Hearth.",

Inspired by a time when the Blues were plentiful and rhythm reigned supreme, Jontavious leverages his unique sound—a synthesis of his Georgia heritage and reverence for traditional Blues—to get the world dancing again. A Grammy-nominated musician and songwriter, Jontavious performs original, toe-tapping tunes in the style of Delta, Piedmont, Texas, and Gospel Blues. Dynamic vocals, technical prowess, and an abundance of Southern charm keep Jontavious sending jolts of vitality through the Blues community.  Jontavious was born and raised in rural Georgia, an environment with deep cultural roots that provides the inspiration he has continuously drawn upon to create his unique sound. He spent much of his childhood singing Gospel music at the Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church with his grandfather, which provided him his first setting to perform for an audience.

The Norte has long been a crossroads of cultures, and centuries of intersecting histories, trade routes, migrations, and cultural movements have endowed the region with an expansive and rich musical heritage that weaves together Spanish, Mexican, Indigenous, European immigrant, Anglo-American, and Afro-American musical influences. The oldest strands of this tradition have survived in continuity, renewed by each new generation’s contribution to core style and repertoire that has been passed from musician to musician, in some cases over many centuries.  Though rapid cultural change since the ‘50s has led to these sounds becoming scarce in their home territory, they never fully disappeared--thanks to the elders and past generations that lovingly and tenaciously carried them forward, renewing the voice of their musical ancestors at each step into changing circumstances.  The musicians of Lone Piñon learned from elder musicians who instilled in them a respect for continuity and an example of the radicalism, creativity, and cross-cultural solidarity that has always been necessary for musical traditions to adapt and thrive in each generation.  In 2014, Lone Piñon was founded as a platform for creativity around the oldest sounds of traditional New Mexico string music, sounds that had all but disappeared from daily life in many Northern New Mexico communities.  Through relationship with elders, study of field recordings, connections to parallel traditional music and dance revitalization movements in the US and Mexico, and hundreds of local and national performances, they have brought the language of the New Mexico orquesta típica back onto the modern stage, back onto dance floors, into a contemporary aesthetic/artistic conversation, and into the ears of a young generation.  The musical landscape of Northern New Mexico bears the record of interconnecting musical movements that cross state, national, generational, and ethnic borders.

Formed in 2009 in Peshawar, Pakistan as an instrumental quartet, Khumariyaan emerged during a tumultuous period marked by Talibanization, sectarian violence, military operations, and neo- imperialist expansions. In such a climate, art, including music, served as a form of resistance. In the intervening decade, Khumariyaan has expanded its repertory of culturally rooted music, and, in 2024, welcomed a vocalist (and third guitarist) into the mix. Hospitality is central to Pushtoon culture; Khumariyaan welcomes all under its expansive, potent, and intoxicating musical tent.  With its propulsive, furious sound, Khumariyaan, \"The Intoxicators,\" has reawakened the live music scene in Peshawar, the ancient crossroads through the Khyber Pass that links Pakistan and Afghanistan. The lute-like Pashto rubab is the meeting point for this transfixing, hyper-folk quintet that intertwines the djembe-like zerbaghali (clay or wooden goblet drum), sehtar (long-necked lute), and searching vocals underpinned with driving acoustic guitars. Khumariyaan’s rolling pulse and richly layered sound builds to frenzied intensity. It’s an addictive and accessible pleasure that has ushered in a new era for an eclipsed music.  “We are group of individuals that have come together as one soul to experience and share the trance that is live acoustic music. To us, music is the best sublimated form of art. In our journey, we hope to entice musical ‘goose bumps’, and become a moving philosophical experience.” – rubab player and band leader Farhan Bogra.  Khumariyaan began its journey in 2009 and made its US debut tour in 2014 as part of Center Stage. In the intervening decade they’ve shared their work in Europe, the Middle East, and in East Africa, spreading art like water on the fires of fundamentalism in all its forms.

The lute-like Pashto rubab is the meeting point for this transfixing, hyper-folk quintet that intertwines the djembe-like zerbaghali (clay or wooden goblet drum), sehtar (long-necked lute), and searching vocals underpinned with driving acoustic guitars. Khumariyaan’s rolling pulse and richly layered sound builds to frenzied intensity. It’s an addictive and accessible pleasure that has ushered in a new era for an eclipsed music.  “We are group of individuals that have come together as one soul to experience and share the trance that is live acoustic music. To us, music is the best sublimated form of art. In our journey, we hope to entice musical ‘goose bumps’, and become a moving philosophical experience.” – rubab player and band leader Farhan Bogra.  Khumariyaan began its journey in 2009 and made its US debut tour in 2014 as part of Center Stage. In the intervening decade they’ve shared their work in Europe, the Middle East, and in East Africa, spreading art like water on the fires of fundamentalism in all its forms.  Farhan Bogra, founder, plays various ethnic lutes including the rubab and sehtar. Sparlay Rawail plays Dhol and lead guitar. He has a background in studio art and architecture from the National Council of the Arts. Shiraz Khan specializes in percussion and plays the indigenous percussion instrument Zerbaghali. Aamer Shafiq plays rhythm guitar and leads the Attan dance with the band. Obaid Khan is lead vocalist and guitarist. He holds a master's degree in Anthropology.  Farhan Bogra – rabab and sehtar, band leader Sparlay Rawail – lead guitar and dhol Aamer Shafiq – rhythm guitar Shiraz Khan – percussion Obaid Khan - vocals  “ Khumariyaan’s extended tunes spill across the border between Pashtoon folk and jam-band rock. It’s a cool vibe with the extra merit of puncturing stereotypes .” – Boston Globe  Khumariyaan is on tour in the USA as part of Center Stage, an initiative of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs with funding provided by the U.S. Government. It is administered by the New England Foundation for the Arts in cooperation with the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations.

He thinks at the speed of light and can play whatever he thinks of. As an improviser, he is fearless, and his musical vocabulary has no limitations.\" -Chicago Tribune     Grammy-nominated singer and guitarist Michael Daves was heralded as “a leading light of the New York bluegrass scene” by the New York Times. Daves has garnered attention for his work with Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tony Trischka, and Bruce Molksy in addition to his solo performances.  Photo credit: Manish Gosalia"

      "startTime": "Doors 8pm, Show 8:30pm  Michael Daves and Jacob Jolliff are two of America’s premier bluegrass talents. After years of collaborating in various bands and informal settings they have teamed up as a formidable duo featuring high lonesome vocal harmony and fiery flatpicking. Their sound is an homage to the classic guitar-mandolin “brother duets” while leaving plenty of room for improvisation and inspired left turns. They effortlessly straddle the line between hard-core traditional bluegrass and experimental forms.   Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Michael Daves grew up playing bluegrass in the grand old tradition of staying up late &amp; singing loud. Although he’s since moved north, the Southern roots permeate his music, however traditional or experimental.  Heralded as “a leading light of the New York bluegrass scene” by the New York Times, Daves has garnered attention for his work with Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tony Trischka, Bruce Molsky and others in addition to his solo performances. His album “Sleep With One Eye Open” with Thile earned a 2011 Grammy nomination. Daves is also one of the most experienced instructors in bluegrass music, with a vocal school on ArtistWorks, presentations at many festivals, camps, and institutions including Carnegie Hall, and a private studio going back to the mid- 1990s.   Jacob Jolliff has become one of the country's most notable contemporary mandolinists. He was a member of the beloved New England roots band Joy Kills Sorrow, while attending Berklee School of Music on a full scholarship. In 2012, Jolliff won the National Mandolin Championship in Winfield, KS. Now a fixture of the national bluegrass community, he has collaborated and shared the stage with Darol Anger, Sam Bush, Ronnie McCoury, Jerry Douglas, Tony Trischka, and David Grisman among others. When Joy Kills Sorrow disbanded in 2014, Jolliff got the call to join Yonder Mountain String Band with whom he toured full time through 2019. In 2022 Jolliff released a self-titled Jacob Jolliff Band album and toured with Béla Fleck as part of My Bluegrass Heart.  Photo credit: Aidan Grant",
