    "description": "Advance Tickets are SOLD OUT!  A limited number of tickets will be sold at the door, depending on capacity. You can also purchase tickets to watch the livestream!    The New York Oud Festival is a multi-day, multi-venue music festival that displays the oud and its versatility as it exists in New York's diverse musical culture. The NYOF celebrates the oud and its wide-ranging influence on global music culture, showcasing artists from a multitude of traditions and contexts, and demonstrating why the oud continues to be one of the world's most beloved instruments.    www.newyorkoudfestival.com    NY Oud Festival Day 8 |  Gabe Lavin, Ameer Armaly, Brian Prunka 7:30pm (7pm doors) Friday May 30th 2025 Jalopy Theatre - 315 Columbia St, Brooklyn, NY 11231 $30 advance ($35 door)  Day 8 of the festival will feature sets by oudists  Gabe Lavin ,  Ameer Armaly , and  Brian Prunka .  Seating is limited and first-come first-serve.   Born in South Carolina,  Ameer Armaly  was exposed to the oud and Arabic music in general from an early age through his uncle who played the oud.  He went on to study under Simon and Najib Shaheen. Ameer performs as an instrumentalist with a variety of artists and leads an Arabic music ensemble which performs regularly around the New York area, cultivating local talent and reviving the great Arabic instrumental and vocal music of the twentieth century. His performance will feature Ayman Asfour on violin and Zafer Tawil on percussion.    Gabriel Lavin , (Ph.D.) is a Brooklyn-based multi instrumentalist and scholar. He received a degree in oud performance from Beit Al Oud, Abu Dhabi (2024) and has performed as a solo artist and with ensembles across the United States, Oman, Egypt, Kuwait, the UAE, and elsewhere.  Accompanied by Alber Baseel on percussion, his performance will feature various oud playing styles and musical genres from the Arab world and Turkey.     Dubbed \"one of New York’s most eclectic, interesting oudists,” oud player  Brian Prunka ’s compositions have been described as “mesmerizing, intricate, anthemic” (NY Music Daily). He began his musical journey playing jazz guitar in New Orleans before falling in love with the Arabic oud.  Since 2003 he has been deeply involved with New York’s Arabic music scene, performing with Simon Shaheen, Takht al-Nagham, Zikrayat, the NY Arabic orchestra, and the Bil Afrah Project, as well as his original music projects, including his jazz-Arabic project Nashaz and most recently a series of works for oud and string quartet.  For this performance, he will be performing with Gideon Forbes (nay, saxophone, clarinet), Eric Allen (cello) and Alber Baseel (percussion). The music will explore the range of Prunka’s compositions, drawing on influences from maqam, jazz, classical music and more.       The New York Oud Festival is sponsored, in part, by the Greater New York Arts Development Fund of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, administered by Brooklyn Arts Council.",

Sill was an incredible songwriter and composer, one-time bank robber, brilliant pianist and guitar player. Lyrically, her songs play with notions of divine love and cosmic visitations, amongst other things. Musically, her guitar playing is eccentric and inventive, and offers fun ways to unlock a lot of guitar skills.   Intermediate guitar level preferred, meaning: ability to decipher guitar tablature (but not sight-read), and basic comfort with finger picking. We will focus on songs from Judee Sills self-titled debut album.     *For financial aid and payment plans contact Lynette at Lynette@jalopytheatre.org",

    "description": "with Carol Freeman Sunday June 8, 2-4 pm   The exquisite singing of Sephardic Jews has its roots in fifteenth century Spain, but is also deeply influenced by the music and vocal styles of the host countries in which the community lived in diaspora for more than five hundred years.   This workshop will focus on Ladino songs and vocal techniques from the Balkans, Greece, and Asia Minor (Turkey.) The songs, some telling tales of royals going back centuries, others expressing the sorrows and joys of ordinary people in everyday life, feature luxuriant melodies, intricate embellishment, uneven rhythms, and microtonal scales.   This workshop will introduce students to the challenging yet really fun vocal techniques and elements of style that are an essential part of Sephardic singing, as it was done by members of the community in earlier times. Participants will learn how to produce the focused yet delicate sound of traditional Sephardic singers, discovering how to find the center of their natural voices, and learning to effortlessly sing with increased comfort, clarity and control.   Participants will learn how to sing intricate ornamentation in both the \"ala Turka\" vocal style of Turkey and Greece and the \"sevdalinka\" style of Bosnia. We will learn songs in uneven rhythms and in free meters (no rhythm at all!), and will sing in Turkish microtonal makam. Songs will be taught in detail from original field and vintage commercial 78rpm recordings.   We'll also take a look at how to produce optimal tone quality, and increase vocal strength, stamina, and flexibility, and will learn how to shape a melodic line to effectively communicate a song with superb artistry and depth of expression. Though detailed and precise, the workshop will be conducted in a supportive, relaxed, and fun atmosphere. It is open to singers of all levels, and no prior knowledge of the languages or vocal styles is needed.     Well known as a performer, researcher, and teacher of a variety of Balkan, Greek, Judaic, and other singing traditions,  Carol Freeman  has performed since 1970 as vocalist for The Smyrneiki Kompania, Sevda Balkan Music Ensemble, Song of the Shtetl, Village Voices, and Zhenska Pesna, and as a solo interpreter of traditional song, and has appeared at major arts centers, festivals, museums, and universities, and on radio and television, throughout North America. A master vocal instructor, Carol Freeman has taught extensively as a private instructor and at specialized arts schools, music seminars, universities, and museums for five decades. She is a 2023, 2024, and 2025 New York State Council on the Arts Master of Folk Arts.",

    "description": "with Carol Freeman   Sunday June 8, 5-7 pm   The magnificent music of the Balkans is renowned for its remarkable vocal quality as well as for its haunting melodies, intricate ornamentation, uneven rhythms, and exceptional harmonies. Participants will learn how to produce the distinctively powerful yet effortless sound of Balkan singers and will also learn songs selected from beautiful, centuries old, traditional village and urban repertoires from Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, and other Balkan lands, taught from original field and vintage recordings. The songs include solo, antiphonal, diaphonic, and polyphonic songs originally used to accompany women’s work in the fields, spinning and embroidering parties, rites of passage and calendar event folk rituals, and community celebrations, as well as complex free-metered songs traditionally performed to help pass the long winter nights, and lighter, Ottoman influenced songs whose seductive sounds filled urban cafes.   The workshop will enable students to learn the challenging vocal techniques and stylistic elements that are an essential part of singing many genres of Balkan song. Singers will learn to find the center of their natural voices, and effortlessly sing with increased comfort, clarity, and control. They will learn how to sing intricate embellishments, microtonal melodies, odd meters, and beautifully dissonant  harmonies, through a process that is fluid and fun. Students will learn how to perfectly control intonation and produce optimal tone quality, and increase vocal strength,  stamina, and flexibility. Participants will also learn how to shape a melodic line to effectively communicate a song with superb artistry and depth of expression through carefully placed emphasis and ornamentation. Though detailed and precise, the workshop will be conducted in a supportive and  relaxed atmosphere, and is open to singers of all levels. No prior knowledge of the languages or vocal styles is necessary.   Well known as a performer, researcher, and teacher of a variety of Balkan, Greek, Judaic, and other singing traditions,  Carol Freeman  has performed since 1970 as  vocalist for The Smyrneiki Kompania, Sevda Balkan Music Ensemble, Song of the Shtetl, Village Voices, and Zhenska Pesna, and as a solo interpreter of traditional song, and has appeared at major arts centers, festivals, museums, and universities, and on radio and television, throughout North America. A master vocal instructor, Carol Freeman has taught extensively as a private instructor and at specialized arts schools, music seminars, universities, and museums for five decades. She is a 2023, 2024, and 2025 New York State Council on the Arts Master of Folk Arts.",

Stuck in a period of emotional and artistic limbo, the artist begins an unlikely conversation with a periplaneta americana dwelling in the hidden crevices of her apartment. This unexpected relationship sets her on a path of self-discovery, leading her beyond the constraints of musical scores and into a new, empowered identity.  Through classical and electric guitar, poetry, and song, The Cockroach Diary is an intimate and explosive experience that transcends genre — drawing listeners into the mind of an artist navigating healing and transformation.

    "description": "Doors 7:30pm, Show 8pm $30 adv / $35 DOS   Bruce Molsky  is one of the most revered “multi-hyphenated career” ambassadors for America’s old-time mountain music. For decades, he’s been a globetrotting performer, ethnomusicologist and educator, a recording artist with an expansive discography including seven solo albums, well over a dozen collaborations and two Grammy-nominations. He’s also the classic “musician’s musician” – a man who’s received high praise from diverse fans and collaborators like Linda Ronstadt, Mark Knopfler, Celtic giants Donal Lunny and Andy Irvine, jazzer Bill Frisell and dobro master Jerry Douglas, a true country gentleman by way of the Big Apple aptly dubbed “the Rembrandt of Appalachian fiddlers” by virtuoso violinist and sometimes bandmate Darol Anger.      Tony Trischka  is considered to be the consummate banjo artist and perhaps the most influential banjo player in the roots music world. For more than 45 years, his stylings have inspired a whole generation of bluegrass and acoustic musicians with the many voices he has brought to the instrument. He’s been nominated twice for a Grammy award, at both the 40th and 50th annual Grammy ceremonies. He won three awards at the 2007 International Bluegrass Music Association gathering, including Recorded Event of the Year and Banjo Player of the Year.  As a trio, Molsky, Trischka and Daves find raucously good-natured common ground between bluegrass and old-time styles.     Heralded as “a leading light of the New York bluegrass scene” by the New York Times, Georgia-born guitarist/singer  Michael Daves  has garnered attention for his work with Tony Trischka, Steve Martin, and Chris Thile, with whom he shares a Grammy nomination for their 2011 album Sleep With One Eye Open. Daves’ unruly interpretations of American roots music standards have won him a place of almost fanatical admiration as a \"renegade traditionalist.\" His most recent project is the double album Orchids and Violence, which renders identical track lists in contrasting bluegrass and experimental electric styles.",

He lives in Ithaca NY, and tours regularly in the US, Ireland and Canada.       WWW.JOECROOKSTON.COM   Selena Tibert  is an alternative folk artist and musician based in Brooklyn. Grounded in expertly crafted musical arrangements with a clear, rich vocal, her songs pulse with modern jazz and 70s folk influence. Lyrically, she treats personal and universal narratives with mythological reverence, best exemplified in each line of her latest record, The Fool.  Raised in ruggedly beautiful Camano Island, WA in the Pacific Northwest, Selena Tibert’s early life was colored with music and storytelling. Her parents, also musicians, raised her on genre classics like Carole King, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young. She’s brought her enigmatic songs to life across the country from Seattle and Portland to Boston and beyond, including storied NYC venues The Bowery Electric, Berlin, Rockwood Music Hall, and more.  In June of 2024, Selena Tibert released her debut EP,  The Fool . The record was produced, arranged, and engineered entirely by Tibert, whose other skill lies in sourcing exceptional talent to help bring her vision to life. The EP was mixed and mastered by Tom Gardner at Rift Studios in Brooklyn. In live performance, these songs are lifted from their recorded arrangements with careful precision, while allowing room for adept improvisation from Tibert’s band. Sonically, the record is both grounded and mercurial, evoking Marika Hackman and Anaïs Mitchell. “At the same time powerful and subtle, this voice expresses a full palette of emotions,” writes  Indiefferential .   Her two previous releases, singles “Where It’s Dark” and “Feels Like a Sin”, are impressive standalones. “Where It’s Dark”, Tibert’s first release and also self-produced, is darkly inviting, blending acoustic folk with gently synthesized vocal harmonies. Drawing comparisons to 70s rock storytellers Uriah Heep and legendary singer-songwriter Janis Ian,  The Other Side Reviews  writes: “The soothing, almost raw arrangement draws you into a spine-chilling melody; however, it is Tibert’s ethereal vocals that enhance a sense of intoxicating breathlessness to the haunting single.”   “Feels Like a Sin” acts thematically like sister-song to “Where It’s Dark”, but leans more heavily on the modern folk sounds of Laura Marling or Haley Heynderickx. Deftly addressing feelings of social anxiety, it’s a deeply personal song without being overly sentimental or self-deprecating; another testament to Tibert’s writing.   Selena Tibert has released sold out direct-to-vinyl sessions with Leesta Vall Sound Recordings in Brooklyn, and produced, arranged, and engineered the single “Sweet Thing” with fellow NYC folk duo Hearth.",

    "description": "Doors 8pm, Show 8:30pm $20 adv / $25 DOS  Lone Piñon is a New Mexican string band, or “orquesta típica”, whose music celebrates the integrity and diversity of their region's cultural roots. With fiddles, upright bass, guitars, accordions, vihuela, and bilingual vocals, they play a wide spectrum of the traditional music that is at home in New Mexico.  The Norte has long been a crossroads of cultures, and centuries of intersecting histories, trade routes, migrations, and cultural movements have endowed the region with an expansive and rich musical heritage that weaves together Spanish, Mexican, Indigenous, European immigrant, Anglo-American, and Afro-American musical influences. The oldest strands of this tradition have survived in continuity, renewed by each new generation’s contribution to core style and repertoire that has been passed from musician to musician, in some cases over many centuries.  Though rapid cultural change since the ‘50s has led to these sounds becoming scarce in their home territory, they never fully disappeared--thanks to the elders and past generations that lovingly and tenaciously carried them forward, renewing the voice of their musical ancestors at each step into changing circumstances.  The musicians of Lone Piñon learned from elder musicians who instilled in them a respect for continuity and an example of the radicalism, creativity, and cross-cultural solidarity that has always been necessary for musical traditions to adapt and thrive in each generation.  In 2014, Lone Piñon was founded as a platform for creativity around the oldest sounds of traditional New Mexico string music, sounds that had all but disappeared from daily life in many Northern New Mexico communities.  Through relationship with elders, study of field recordings, connections to parallel traditional music and dance revitalization movements in the US and Mexico, and hundreds of local and national performances, they have brought the language of the New Mexico orquesta típica back onto the modern stage, back onto dance floors, into a contemporary aesthetic/artistic conversation, and into the ears of a young generation.  The musical landscape of Northern New Mexico bears the record of interconnecting musical movements that cross state, national, generational, and ethnic borders. Lone Piñon’s active and recorded repertoire reflects that complexity, and has included a wide range of regionally-relevant material (Western swing, conjunto, New Mexican Spanish and Mexican ranchera, Central Mexican son regional, country, onda chicana, etc.) around the core New Mexican violin and accordion-driven polkas, cunas, inditas, valses, and chotes learned from elders.",

    "description": "Doors 8pm, Show 8:30pm $20 adv / $25 DOS  Khumariyaan is celebrated for blending traditional folk music with modern styles. The band's name, translates as \"the state of musical intoxication,\" capturing the essence of this hyper-folk jam band. Formed in 2009 in Peshawar, Pakistan as an instrumental quartet, Khumariyaan emerged during a tumultuous period marked by Talibanization, sectarian violence, military operations, and neo- imperialist expansions. In such a climate, art, including music, served as a form of resistance. In the intervening decade, Khumariyaan has expanded its repertory of culturally rooted music, and, in 2024, welcomed a vocalist (and third guitarist) into the mix. Hospitality is central to Pushtoon culture; Khumariyaan welcomes all under its expansive, potent, and intoxicating musical tent.  With its propulsive, furious sound, Khumariyaan, \"The Intoxicators,\" has reawakened the live music scene in Peshawar, the ancient crossroads through the Khyber Pass that links Pakistan and Afghanistan. The lute-like Pashto rubab is the meeting point for this transfixing, hyper-folk quintet that intertwines the djembe-like zerbaghali (clay or wooden goblet drum), sehtar (long-necked lute), and searching vocals underpinned with driving acoustic guitars. Khumariyaan’s rolling pulse and richly layered sound builds to frenzied intensity. It’s an addictive and accessible pleasure that has ushered in a new era for an eclipsed music.  “We are group of individuals that have come together as one soul to experience and share the trance that is live acoustic music. To us, music is the best sublimated form of art. In our journey, we hope to entice musical ‘goose bumps’, and become a moving philosophical experience.” – rubab player and band leader Farhan Bogra.  Khumariyaan began its journey in 2009 and made its US debut tour in 2014 as part of Center Stage. In the intervening decade they’ve shared their work in Europe, the Middle East, and in East Africa, spreading art like water on the fires of fundamentalism in all its forms.  Farhan Bogra, founder, plays various ethnic lutes including the rubab and sehtar. Sparlay Rawail plays Dhol and lead guitar. He has a background in studio art and architecture from the National Council of the Arts. Shiraz Khan specializes in percussion and plays the indigenous percussion instrument Zerbaghali. Aamer Shafiq plays rhythm guitar and leads the Attan dance with the band. Obaid Khan is lead vocalist and guitarist. He holds a master's degree in Anthropology.  Farhan Bogra – rabab and sehtar, band leader Sparlay Rawail – lead guitar and dhol Aamer Shafiq – rhythm guitar Shiraz Khan – percussion Obaid Khan - vocals  “ Khumariyaan’s extended tunes spill across the border between Pashtoon folk and jam-band rock. It’s a cool vibe with the extra merit of puncturing stereotypes .” – Boston Globe  Khumariyaan is on tour in the USA as part of Center Stage, an initiative of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs with funding provided by the U.S. Government. It is administered by the New England Foundation for the Arts in cooperation with the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations.

After years of collaborating in various bands and informal settings they have teamed up as a formidable duo featuring high lonesome vocal harmony and fiery flatpicking. Their sound is an homage to the classic guitar-mandolin “brother duets” while leaving plenty of room for improvisation and inspired left turns. They effortlessly straddle the line between hard-core traditional bluegrass and experimental forms.   Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Michael Daves grew up playing bluegrass in the grand old tradition of staying up late &amp; singing loud. Although he’s since moved north, the Southern roots permeate his music, however traditional or experimental.  Heralded as “a leading light of the New York bluegrass scene” by the New York Times, Daves has garnered attention for his work with Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tony Trischka, Bruce Molsky and others in addition to his solo performances. His album “Sleep With One Eye Open” with Thile earned a 2011 Grammy nomination. Daves is also one of the most experienced instructors in bluegrass music, with a vocal school on ArtistWorks, presentations at many festivals, camps, and institutions including Carnegie Hall, and a private studio going back to the mid- 1990s.   Jacob Jolliff has become one of the country's most notable contemporary mandolinists. He was a member of the beloved New England roots band Joy Kills Sorrow, while attending Berklee School of Music on a full scholarship. In 2012, Jolliff won the National Mandolin Championship in Winfield, KS. Now a fixture of the national bluegrass community, he has collaborated and shared the stage with Darol Anger, Sam Bush, Ronnie McCoury, Jerry Douglas, Tony Trischka, and David Grisman among others. When Joy Kills Sorrow disbanded in 2014, Jolliff got the call to join Yonder Mountain String Band with whom he toured full time through 2019. In 2022 Jolliff released a self-titled Jacob Jolliff Band album and toured with Béla Fleck as part of My Bluegrass Heart.  Photo credit: Aidan Grant",
