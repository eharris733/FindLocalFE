      "description": "A truly extraordinary artist,   Andy Statman   began his career in the 70’s as a virtuoso Mandolinist who studied and performed with David Grisman, went on to study clarinet with the legendary Dave Tarras and became one of the main architect of a Klezmer revival that started out 30 years ago and has since informed and influenced folk, Jazz and improvised music forms. Andy draws equally from Hassidic melodies, folk tunes from new and old worlds alike and Albert Ayler-influenced free-improv. The result reads like a very personal search for the sacred based both on traditions and introspection.  Featuring  Larry Eagle -  drums ; Jim Whitney -  bass and  Andy Statman -  clarinet and mandolin.     $20 tickets. Reserve now or pay in person that night.

The multi-instrumentalists and composers have known each other and performed together for over 10 years, primarily in the New Orleans music scene, though their collaboration on this project began in 2023.

Their music is richly informed by these experiences, grounding their collaboration in dialogues around improvisation and composition, performance, art and collectivity.

Andy draws equally from Hassidic melodies, folk tunes from new and old worlds alike and Albert Ayler-influenced free-improv. The result reads like a very personal search for the sacred based both on traditions and introspection.  Featuring  Larry Eagle -  drums ; Jim Whitney -  bass and  Andy Statman -  clarinet and mandolin.     $20 tickets. Reserve now or pay in person that night.      Tickets do not guarantee a seat - just admission. Half of the room will be standing.  We suggest getting there at least 30 minutes ahead to get a seat.&nbsp;"

The journey, which begins with the silence and fear to speak of hardworking women in northern Argentina turns into a collective demand by the concert’s conclusion. In this way, music becomes a powerful tool for articulating what has long remained invisible.    The repertoire spans Argentine and Latin American popular music composed between the '50s and '80s. Some of the artists revisited are  Violeta Parra  (Chile),  Chabuca Granda  (Perú),  Eladia Blázquez, María Elena Walsh  (Argentina), and Amparo Ochoa (Mexico).&nbsp; Sexist violence, abortion, domestic and unpaid care work are some of the crucial topics that are addressed along the concert.

The Goldberg Variations (c. 1741) stand as one of the most profound and technically brilliant works in the keyboard repertoire. The work consists of an aria and 30 variations, showcasing Bach’s unparalleled mastery of counterpoint, harmony, and keyboard technique.     The story goes that Bach composed the Goldberg Variations for Count Hermann Karl von Keyserling, who requested pieces that were “soothing and cheerful” This was so his young harpsichordist, Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, could perform them to comfort him during his restless evenings as he struggled with his condition. The Count would call upon young Goldberg to play the variations, finding healing and transformative power in the music.     Beyza Yazgan is a Turkish pianist, composer, and multidisciplinary artist. She holds a doctorate in piano performance from Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University in Istanbul (a year in Chopin Academy in Warsaw). After moving to New York in 2016, she earned a Professional Studies diploma from Mannes School of Music, where she received the Josef Fidelman Contemporary  Music Performance Award.  She has performed in diverse locations ranging from traditional venues such as Weill Recital Hall in Carnegie Hall to ancient caves in Turkey. After winning first prize at the 8th Metropolitan International Piano Competition, she produced her debut album, To Anatolia:  Selections from the Turkish Five, released by Bridge Records in 2021.

A Memphis native, Crump fell for New York’s fecund scenes during his first semester at Amherst College, when he would drive hours to play late- night, weekday gigs in the West Village. He knew this is where he’d make his life and career. Working beyond genre, he has become a crucial component of multiple New York music communities in and beyond jazz. For two decades, Crump recorded and toured as a third of Vijay Iyer’s acclaimed trio, helping to build that band’s global reputation. Meanwhile, many of his own ensembles—Rhombal, with Tyshawn Sorey, Ellery Eskelin, and Adam O’Farrill; Secret Keeper, with Mary Halvorson; Rosetta Trio, with Jamie Fox and Liberty Ellman—prize versatility and voicings in a manner that more traditional configurations often do not.

Andy draws equally from Hassidic melodies, folk tunes from new and old worlds alike and Albert Ayler-influenced free-improv.

The multi-instrumentalists and composers have known each other and performed together for over 10 years, primarily in the New Orleans music scene, though their collaboration on this project began in 2023. In addition to their shared experiences as musicians, their friendship is deepened by strikingly similar life paths prior to meeting – including past work in avant garde theater and formal studies in philosophy and religion. Their music is richly informed by these experiences, grounding their collaboration in dialogues around improvisation and composition, performance, art and collectivity.  Their debut recording  Kiss of the Earth  was released in April 2025 on noted Brooklyn-based adventurous music label 577 Records.      $20 suggested. Donate now online or that night in person.

Each song is a narrative in itself, allowing the performer to delve into the story of its composer, its protagonist, or the women’s rights issue it addresses. The journey, which begins with the silence and fear to speak of hardworking women in northern Argentina turns into a collective demand by the concert’s conclusion. In this way, music becomes a powerful tool for articulating what has long remained invisible.    The repertoire spans Argentine and Latin American popular music composed between the '50s and '80s. Some of the artists revisited are  Violeta Parra  (Chile),  Chabuca Granda  (Perú),  Eladia Blázquez, María Elena Walsh  (Argentina), and Amparo Ochoa (Mexico).&nbsp; Sexist violence, abortion, domestic and unpaid care work are some of the crucial topics that are addressed along the concert.

      "description": "BEYZA YAZGAN Plays BACH'S COMPLETE GOLDBERG VARIATIONS    Experience Bach’s transcendent masterpiece, “Goldberg Variations”brought to life by award-winning Turkish pianist and composer Beyza Yazgan in an intimate space.  The Goldberg Variations (c. 1741) stand as one of the most profound and technically brilliant works in the keyboard repertoire. The work consists of an aria and 30 variations, showcasing Bach’s unparalleled mastery of counterpoint, harmony, and keyboard technique.     The story goes that Bach composed the Goldberg Variations for Count Hermann Karl von Keyserling, who requested pieces that were “soothing and cheerful” This was so his young harpsichordist, Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, could perform them to comfort him during his restless evenings as he struggled with his condition. The Count would call upon young Goldberg to play the variations, finding healing and transformative power in the music.     Beyza Yazgan is a Turkish pianist, composer, and multidisciplinary artist. She holds a doctorate in piano performance from Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University in Istanbul (a year in Chopin Academy in Warsaw). After moving to New York in 2016, she earned a Professional Studies diploma from Mannes School of Music, where she received the Josef Fidelman Contemporary  Music Performance Award.  She has performed in diverse locations ranging from traditional venues such as Weill Recital Hall in Carnegie Hall to ancient caves in Turkey. After winning first prize at the 8th Metropolitan International Piano Competition, she produced her debut album, To Anatolia:  Selections from the Turkish Five, released by Bridge Records in 2021. Her first album of original compositions, Human Cocoon, was released in July 2024 and selected as The Guardian’s “Contemporary album of the month     “Even at her most artless and unaffected, she can wrench emotion out of simplicity.” — The Guardian  www.beyzayazgan.com      $20 suggested -  Donate online now or in person that day.&nbsp;",

      "description": "Stephan Crump    - Passerine  Ches Smith  • percussion   Kenny Warren  • trumpet   David Leon  • alto flute &amp; saxophone   Stephan Crump  • acoustic bass     Memphis-bred, Grammy-nominated, Brooklyn-based composer and bassist Stephan Crump presents an extraordinary new quartet and body of work inspired by nests and birds.      “as a bassist and composer, Mr. Crump avoids obvious routes but manages never to lose his way” -   The New York Times     “a visionary artist who can convey profound themes through the medium of sound”  -  AllAboutJazz      Stephan Crump is a bassist and composer, collaborator and bandleader, soloist and educator, based in New York City since 1994. A Memphis native, Crump fell for New York’s fecund scenes during his first semester at Amherst College, when he would drive hours to play late- night, weekday gigs in the West Village. He knew this is where he’d make his life and career. Working beyond genre, he has become a crucial component of multiple New York music communities in and beyond jazz. For two decades, Crump recorded and toured as a third of Vijay Iyer’s acclaimed trio, helping to build that band’s global reputation. Meanwhile, many of his own ensembles—Rhombal, with Tyshawn Sorey, Ellery Eskelin, and Adam O’Farrill; Secret Keeper, with Mary Halvorson; Rosetta Trio, with Jamie Fox and Liberty Ellman—prize versatility and voicings in a manner that more traditional configurations often do not. His Borderlands Trio, with pianist Kris Davis and drummer Eric McPherson, brings this same mentality to a more familiar setting. Other collaborators have included Miguel Zenón, Gordon Gano, Patti Austin, Johnny Clyde Copeland, Wadada Leo Smith, Jim Campilongo, David Gilmore, Sam Newsome, Steve Lehman, Cory Smythe, Ingrid Laubrock, Okkyung Lee, Mat Maneri, and Ches Smith. Crump’s physical and emotional connection to the bass is abundant through the new sextet Slow Water, which explores ecology and environment through composition and group communication. He teaches  On Magnetism , a course in connecting more deeply through one’s instrument, after a lifetime of doing just that, and lives still in Brooklyn with his wife and collaborator, the singer Jen Chapin, and their two sons.&nbsp;     $20&nbsp; Purchase tickets here in advance or in person during the performance",
