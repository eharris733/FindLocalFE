Inspired by a time when the Blues were plentiful and rhythm reigned supreme, Jontavious leverages his unique sound—a synthesis of his Georgia heritage and reverence for traditional Blues—to get the world dancing again. A Grammy-nominated musician and songwriter, Jontavious performs original, toe-tapping tunes in the style of Delta, Piedmont, Texas, and Gospel Blues. Dynamic vocals, technical prowess, and an abundance of Southern charm keep Jontavious sending jolts of vitality through the Blues community.  Jontavious was born and raised in rural Georgia, an environment with deep cultural roots that provides the inspiration he has continuously drawn upon to create his unique sound. He spent much of his childhood singing Gospel music at the Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church with his grandfather, which provided him his first setting to perform for an audience. An early phenom, his passion for the Blues was sparked at age 14 when he came across a YouTube video of Muddy Waters playing “Hoochie Coochie Man.” He achieved widespread acclaim when living legend Taj Mahal invited Jontavious to accompany him onstage in 2015, with Taj describing him as his “Wonderboy.” Jontavious was invited to open for Taj Mahal and Keb’ Mo’ during their joint TajMo tour in 2018, giving him an opportunity to present his work on a national stage.      Blues Dance New York     is dedicated to fostering community and encouraging lifelong learning through a shared passion for blues dancing and blues music as forms of expression. We endeavor to share knowledge about the history of blues dance and music.  Everyone has the right to dance, and people moving and learning together can lead to powerful experiences. We are dedicated to creating spaces where people feel brave, respected, and welcomed.  Blues is more than a dance: it brings people together.",

Advance $15 / Day of Show $20 7:30 PM – Doors 8:00 PM – Tipa Tipo (Acoustic) 9:00 PM – Celeste Krishna (Full Band)     Celeste Krishna   Spotify Playlist     Celeste Krishna is an artist and producer who composes songs as a life practice, blending her Motown-infused Southern rock arrangements with the emotional vulnerability of soul. Originally from Birmingham, Alabama and now based in New York City, Celeste’s work is characterized by a \"disarmingly soulful\" style and has earned her recognition as a “true-blue southern soul in lyrics &amp; voice\" by  The Austin Chronicle .    This year she will be releasing her sixth studio album,  The New Room , a 10-song LP in which she combines head-nodding rock grooves with poetic storytelling about the complexities of being a modern woman from the South. Her style is sonically steeped in the rock and roll musical traditions of the American South yet is undeniably fresh in interpretation, flipping the script on the male-dominated legacies of Southern rock.    The lyrics in  The New Room  explore themes of migration, home, love, fertility, and artistry, often weaving poignant vulnerability with humor and social critique. She artfully enhances the depth and range of her storytelling through her skillful arrangement of soulful electric pianos, gritty guitar riffs, and intricate horn and vocal parts.    Celeste’s previous records have earned her considerable success, including 11.5 million streams on Spotify &amp; Pandora and the sync placement of her song “Come On &amp; Move Me” on NBC’s  Good Girls .  The New Room  promises to build on these successes, showcasing Celeste’s talents not only as a vocalist and songwriter, but also as a composer, arranger, and producer, delivering a thoughtful and catchy rumination on American identity in complex times.     Tipa Tipo   Spotify Artist Page     Brooklyn-based combo Tipa Tipo fuses the spirit of '70s soft rock and disco with Latin rhythms to create their fresh take on tropical yacht rock en español. Originally formed in Lima (Perú), the band plays live as a trio fronted by co-producers Adele Fournet and Felipe Wurst with Jordan Auber on drums. The band packs the sonic force of a much bigger ensemble by combining contrapuntal synth bass lines, tight vocal harmonies, intoxicating guitar, and electric piano textures.    In 2024, Tipa Tipo released their first full-length album,  Cintas , featuring Fournet and Wurst’s distinctive production style synthesizing retro pop with Peruvian cumbia. This release comes in the wake of many recent successes for the band, including their Lincoln Center debut and the release of their first two EPs —  El Chari (2021) and  2 Al Azar  (2022) — which gained attention throughout Latin America and U.S. Latinx independent music circles.    Their single “Voy Por Ella” was recently featured on the Mexican TV series  Soy Tu Fan . You can catch their tunes on radio stations including KEXP, KCSN, WFUV, and WXPN (NPR’s  World Café ), with write-ups on  Paste ,  Bandcamp ,  Rock Achorao  (Perú),  WNYC’s New Sounds , and more.  Bandcamp Daily  calls  Cintas  “an overall wonderful debut” with “clean guitars, sweet vocals, and lyrics that touch on political and feminist issues.” Their next LP is forthcoming in late 2025.",

The Norte has long been a crossroads of cultures, and centuries of intersecting histories, trade routes, migrations, and cultural movements have endowed the region with an expansive and rich musical heritage that weaves together Spanish, Mexican, Indigenous, European immigrant, Anglo-American, and Afro-American musical influences. The oldest strands of this tradition have survived in continuity, renewed by each new generation’s contribution to core style and repertoire that has been passed from musician to musician, in some cases over many centuries.

The musicians of Lone Piñon learned from elder musicians who instilled in them a respect for continuity and an example of the radicalism, creativity, and cross-cultural solidarity that has always been necessary for musical traditions to adapt and thrive in each generation.  In 2014, Lone Piñon was founded as a platform for creativity around the oldest sounds of traditional New Mexico string music, sounds that had all but disappeared from daily life in many Northern New Mexico communities.  Through relationship with elders, study of field recordings, connections to parallel traditional music and dance revitalization movements in the US and Mexico, and hundreds of local and national performances, they have brought the language of the New Mexico orquesta típica back onto the modern stage, back onto dance floors, into a contemporary aesthetic/artistic conversation, and into the ears of a young generation.  The musical landscape of Northern New Mexico bears the record of interconnecting musical movements that cross state, national, generational, and ethnic borders.

Formed in 2009 in Peshawar, Pakistan as an instrumental quartet, Khumariyaan emerged during a tumultuous period marked by Talibanization, sectarian violence, military operations, and neo- imperialist expansions. In such a climate, art, including music, served as a form of resistance. In the intervening decade, Khumariyaan has expanded its repertory of culturally rooted music, and, in 2024, welcomed a vocalist (and third guitarist) into the mix. Hospitality is central to Pushtoon culture; Khumariyaan welcomes all under its expansive, potent, and intoxicating musical tent.  With its propulsive, furious sound, Khumariyaan, \"The Intoxicators,\" has reawakened the live music scene in Peshawar, the ancient crossroads through the Khyber Pass that links Pakistan and Afghanistan.

It’s an addictive and accessible pleasure that has ushered in a new era for an eclipsed music.  “We are group of individuals that have come together as one soul to experience and share the trance that is live acoustic music.

The revered, if a bit enigmatic, singer, songwriter and guitarist has spent years honing his layered style. Dedicated only to the pursuit of a new groove or an old feeling, his songs rehash the sights and sounds of a reformed nomad with roots in Iowa, footprints in San Francisco, New Orleans and Chicago, and a home in Nashville.   McLaughlin's compositions have been recorded by a jaw-dropping array of artists including  John Prine, Taj Mahal, Dan Auerbach, Bonnie Raitt, Yola, Marcus King, The Bahamas, Phoebe Bridgers, Tanya Tucker, George Strait, Steve Wariner, Gary Allan, Alan Jackson, Josh Turner, Tricia Yearwood, Mandy Barnett, Sierra Hull, Sierra Ferrel, Don Williams, John Anderson, Robert Finley, Gibson Brothers, Brandi Carlile, Nanci Griffith, Jamie Hartford, Shawn Camp, Ricky Van Shelton, Robert Earl Keen, Britti, Early James, Brit Taylor, Boy Named Banjo, Ian Tyson, Eric Church, Hayes Carll, Rag’n’Bone Man, Shannon and the Clams, Traveling’ McCourys, Kim Ritchie, Dee White, Brett Eldridge, Kendall Marvell, Al Kooper, Subdudes, Tiny Town, The Brummies, Miles Kane, Aubrey Peeples, Vince Herman, Nat Myers, Nathaniel Rateliff, Kurt Vile, Delbert McClinton, Tim O’Brien, Lee Ann Womack, McKinley James, Matt Warren.  Gary Allan recorded Pat's \"Songs About Rain,\" and Josh Turner recorded “Firecracker,” securing yet two more BMI Country Awards for McLaughlin. An in-demand studio musician, Pat's guitar \"chunking\" finessed projects by Neil Diamond, Jamie Hartford, Rosanne Cash, Julie Roberts, Don Williams, Al Cooper, John Doe, Cowboy Jack Clement, Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys) and many more.  As further testament to McLaughlin's skill, Pat was called on to play acoustic guitar for the Rick Rubin produced Johnny Cash American recordings. Pat McLaughlin frequently finds himself working alongside legends. A regular collaborator of John Prine, Pat was a 2 time nominee at the 2018 Grammy awards for the songs “Summer’s End” and “Knockin’ on your Screen Door,” both recorded by John Prine. In 2019, he was once again a Grammy nominee for “Far Away Look,” written with Yola and Dan Auerbach. In 2020 Pat took home the Grammy for “I Remember Everything,” recorded by John Prine. Rolling Stone called McLaughlin \"a tasty, rootsy gem,\" while he prompted the Tennessean's Peter Cooper to spout poetry: \"Groove and soul, slink and stutter, groove and soul, wisdom and pain, groove and soul.\"  In 2006, McLaughlin released Horsefly, again featuring the co-production credits of McLaughlin and Kenny Greenberg.  Loose but focused, the tracks ebb and flow seamlessly, offering wry observations on life's satisfactions and misfires. Melancholy honey and sweet desperation swap stories, while unadulterated happiness sweeps in as well.  Today, McLaughlin finds himself immersed in the Nashville songwriting scene. However, the true magic happens when Pat regularly brings down the house playing live gigs with his jaw dropping band, “The Men In My Life” (Kenny Greenberg, Steve Mackie, and Greg Morrow). \"No one since Dan Penn has better mixed '60s soul idioms with country music sentiment,\" proclaimed the Chicago Sun-Times. \"Pat McLaughlin is an American treasure.\"  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- With a music career spanning more than 40 years,  David Ferguson  has engineered landmark albums for Johnny Cash, opened a recording studio with John Prine, and shared a Grammy win with Sturgill Simpson. Now the Nashville native has become a compelling recording artist in his own right with  Nashville No More , his debut album on Fat Possum Records.  The self-produced project gathers an exceptional cast of friends from the city’s Americana and bluegrass community, while the track listing is simply a reflection of songs he likes. Some selections are familiar, but others are landing on a record for the first time. And even though Ferguson (better known around town as “Fergie”) says he recorded these songs as a way to pass the time during the pandemic, Nashville No More nonetheless carries him out of the control room and into a deserving spotlight.  “I always knew I was going to be in this business, always,” he says. “I think I knew I was going to be a recording engineer when I was about 15 years old. I've loved music all my life, but I never really listened to the lyrics of a song until I was in my 20s. I was just listening to the music, the whole thing. I guess I started noticing lyrics in my mid-20s, trying to figure out what a good song was then.”  That revelation coincided with a dream gig working for the legendary producer “Cowboy” Jack Clement, who hired Ferguson as a teenager to run errands. Ferguson heard about the job from the owner of the Old-Time Picking Parlor, a long-forgotten club and guitar repair shop in downtown Nashville. He took the job without knowing about Clement’s crucial role in establishing artists like Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, and Charley Pride. He stayed on for decades, engineering and producing records for newcomers and icons alike.  “I loved it. That was the best job in the world,” Ferguson says now. “A really good job for a young guy with very little education. ‘Cowboy’ gave me a chance.”  Those professional relationships followed him to his own Music Row studio called the Naughty Pines, a small, rented room where he produced demos and kept the door open for Cash, who liked to stretch out on the small couch. In the late ‘90s and early 2000s, Cash enlisted Ferguson (with producer Rick Rubin’s blessing) to engineer multiple sessions for the American Recordings series of albums, capturing modern classics like “Hurt” and “The Mercy Seat.”  John Prine, whom Ferguson remembers as “a great hang,” was another regular presence at the Naughty Pines. But when an adjoining tenant constantly complained about all the cigarette smoke, Fergie had no choice but to relocate. So, he and Prine launched a new studio they named the Butcher Shoppe, due to its unassuming location next to a former meat processing plant.  Many prominent Americana artists recorded there, including Tyler Childers, Margo Price and Sturgill Simpson. Fergie picked up a Grammy when Simpson’s A Sailor’s Guide to Earth – recorded at theButcher Shoppe -- won the 2016 Grammy for Best Country Album. But once the entire property was sold in 2020, the Butcher Shoppe became yet another casualty of the New Nashville. “We were there for a long time, about 15 years, and it was nice to have,” he says. “All good things come to an end.”  Not to be deterred, Fergie moved all of his recording equipment to his home studio, located on an acreage far from the city limits, and started cutting songs.   He recorded two of the tracks years ago, after singing them at a wedding. Others are by steadfast songwriters such as Guy Clark, Stephen Foster, Lee Hazlewood, Gordon Lightfoot, and Ian Tyson. Notable Nashville songwriters like Roger Cook, Pat McLaughlin, and Allen Reynolds are represented as well, with a pair of songs from his late friend,  Charles Cochran.  Throughout the album, Ferguson’s baritone conveys sincerity, not to mention life experience. The timbre of his vocal is believable whether he’s singing the wistful “Four Strong Winds,” or a love song like “Nights With You.” Meanwhile, the irresistible “Chardonnay” could have been a huge hit for Dean Martin back in the day, just as “Knockin’ Around Nashville” will satisfy longtime country listeners who still miss the piano and pedal steel.    Nashville No More  also stands as a testament to Fergie’s love for bluegrass music, particularly on “Early Morning Rain.” He lights up when remembering the two years he played bass during the final stretch of Jimmy Martin’s career. In addition, Ferguson won a 2013 Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album as an engineer on the Del McCoury Band’s  The Streets of Baltimore .  Bluegrass listeners will easily pick out the all-stars in the credits of Nashville No More: Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, Béla Fleck, Sierra Hull, Ronnie McCoury, Justin Moses, and Tim O’Brien, to name only a few. Will Oldham guests on “Fellow Travelers” and “Looking for You,” while Hull and Price sing exquisite harmony on multiple songs. Ferguson shares guitar duties with players like Dan Auerbach, Mark Howard, Billy Sanford, and Kenny Vaughan.   Nashville No More  brings a long-held family dream to fruition, too. Ferguson’s maternal grandfather moved to Nashville in the 1950s to be a singer and bandleader. But he put his musical ambitions on hold to help his daughter raise her children, including Fergie. Indeed, some of Ferguson’s earliest memories are being cradled in the family’s rocking chair, hearing his mother sing – and it’s fair to say that he’s been drawn to special voices ever since.",

They effortlessly straddle the line between hard-core traditional bluegrass and experimental forms.

His album “Sleep With One Eye Open” with Thile earned a 2011 Grammy nomination. Daves is also one of the most experienced instructors in bluegrass music, with a vocal school on ArtistWorks, presentations at many festivals, camps, and institutions including Carnegie Hall, and a private studio going back to the mid- 1990s.

      "description": "Doors 8pm, Show 8:30pm   Jontavious Willis  is resolved in his mission: to reinvigorate today’s Blues with the spirit of the past. Inspired by a time when the Blues were plentiful and rhythm reigned supreme, Jontavious leverages his unique sound—a synthesis of his Georgia heritage and reverence for traditional Blues—to get the world dancing again. A Grammy-nominated musician and songwriter, Jontavious performs original, toe-tapping tunes in the style of Delta, Piedmont, Texas, and Gospel Blues. Dynamic vocals, technical prowess, and an abundance of Southern charm keep Jontavious sending jolts of vitality through the Blues community.  Jontavious was born and raised in rural Georgia, an environment with deep cultural roots that provides the inspiration he has continuously drawn upon to create his unique sound. He spent much of his childhood singing Gospel music at the Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church with his grandfather, which provided him his first setting to perform for an audience. An early phenom, his passion for the Blues was sparked at age 14 when he came across a YouTube video of Muddy Waters playing “Hoochie Coochie Man.” He achieved widespread acclaim when living legend Taj Mahal invited Jontavious to accompany him onstage in 2015, with Taj describing him as his “Wonderboy.” Jontavious was invited to open for Taj Mahal and Keb’ Mo’ during their joint TajMo tour in 2018, giving him an opportunity to present his work on a national stage.      Blues Dance New York     is dedicated to fostering community and encouraging lifelong learning through a shared passion for blues dancing and blues music as forms of expression. We endeavor to share knowledge about the history of blues dance and music.  Everyone has the right to dance, and people moving and learning together can lead to powerful experiences. We are dedicated to creating spaces where people feel brave, respected, and welcomed.  Blues is more than a dance: it brings people together.",

      "description": "Celeste Krishna brings a Laurel Canyon pen in a Muscle Shoals pocket (full band). Tipa Tipo strips down their tropical yacht rock en español for an acoustic set.  Advance $15 / Day of Show $20 7:30 PM – Doors 8:00 PM – Tipa Tipo (Acoustic) 9:00 PM – Celeste Krishna (Full Band)     Celeste Krishna   Spotify Playlist     Celeste Krishna is an artist and producer who composes songs as a life practice, blending her Motown-infused Southern rock arrangements with the emotional vulnerability of soul. Originally from Birmingham, Alabama and now based in New York City, Celeste’s work is characterized by a \"disarmingly soulful\" style and has earned her recognition as a “true-blue southern soul in lyrics &amp; voice\" by  The Austin Chronicle .    This year she will be releasing her sixth studio album,  The New Room , a 10-song LP in which she combines head-nodding rock grooves with poetic storytelling about the complexities of being a modern woman from the South. Her style is sonically steeped in the rock and roll musical traditions of the American South yet is undeniably fresh in interpretation, flipping the script on the male-dominated legacies of Southern rock.    The lyrics in  The New Room  explore themes of migration, home, love, fertility, and artistry, often weaving poignant vulnerability with humor and social critique. She artfully enhances the depth and range of her storytelling through her skillful arrangement of soulful electric pianos, gritty guitar riffs, and intricate horn and vocal parts.    Celeste’s previous records have earned her considerable success, including 11.5 million streams on Spotify &amp; Pandora and the sync placement of her song “Come On &amp; Move Me” on NBC’s  Good Girls .  The New Room  promises to build on these successes, showcasing Celeste’s talents not only as a vocalist and songwriter, but also as a composer, arranger, and producer, delivering a thoughtful and catchy rumination on American identity in complex times.     Tipa Tipo   Spotify Artist Page     Brooklyn-based combo Tipa Tipo fuses the spirit of '70s soft rock and disco with Latin rhythms to create their fresh take on tropical yacht rock en español. Originally formed in Lima (Perú), the band plays live as a trio fronted by co-producers Adele Fournet and Felipe Wurst with Jordan Auber on drums. The band packs the sonic force of a much bigger ensemble by combining contrapuntal synth bass lines, tight vocal harmonies, intoxicating guitar, and electric piano textures.    In 2024, Tipa Tipo released their first full-length album,  Cintas , featuring Fournet and Wurst’s distinctive production style synthesizing retro pop with Peruvian cumbia. This release comes in the wake of many recent successes for the band, including their Lincoln Center debut and the release of their first two EPs —  El Chari (2021) and  2 Al Azar  (2022) — which gained attention throughout Latin America and U.S. Latinx independent music circles.    Their single “Voy Por Ella” was recently featured on the Mexican TV series  Soy Tu Fan . You can catch their tunes on radio stations including KEXP, KCSN, WFUV, and WXPN (NPR’s  World Café ), with write-ups on  Paste ,  Bandcamp ,  Rock Achorao  (Perú),  WNYC’s New Sounds , and more.  Bandcamp Daily  calls  Cintas  “an overall wonderful debut” with “clean guitars, sweet vocals, and lyrics that touch on political and feminist issues.” Their next LP is forthcoming in late 2025.",

      "description": "Doors 8pm, Show 8:30pm     In the early 1990s when Nirvana played Leadbelly, and Beck played Mississippi John Hurt, folk music made an attempt to hulk along in a new direction on the back of mainstream slacker-rock. Without realizing it, Sean Cronin has picked up that thread with his current band, Gory Dove. Somewhere between his love of jug band music, angular chord changes, and lyrics about small town absurdism, Cronin landed on a sound that seems to belong with the folk-curious grunge pioneers of his youth. Add detuned twelve string guitar, bass sax, pump organ, calf skin drums and you have music unlike any you’ve heard before. This is Cronin’s first return to Jalopy with his original music for the first time since Very Good’s album release in 2019 (Gory Dove being an anagram of Very Good).    Kyle Morgan is a Brooklyn-based songwriter originally from Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, where he grew up singing with his family at church and home.  With influences ranging from the classic roots music of the Carter Family and Hank Williams to more modern artists like Thom Yorke and Rufus Wainwright, Kyle sings songs of spiritual longing, struggle and redemption in an earnest tenor voice. He released three albums in the twenty-teens under the name Starcrossed Losers.  In 2022, his latest record, Younger at Most Everything, came out on Team Love Records under his own name.",

      "description": "Doors 8pm, Show 8:30pm $20 adv / $25 DOS  Lone Piñon is a New Mexican string band, or “orquesta típica”, whose music celebrates the integrity and diversity of their region's cultural roots. With fiddles, upright bass, guitars, accordions, vihuela, and bilingual vocals, they play a wide spectrum of the traditional music that is at home in New Mexico.  The Norte has long been a crossroads of cultures, and centuries of intersecting histories, trade routes, migrations, and cultural movements have endowed the region with an expansive and rich musical heritage that weaves together Spanish, Mexican, Indigenous, European immigrant, Anglo-American, and Afro-American musical influences. The oldest strands of this tradition have survived in continuity, renewed by each new generation’s contribution to core style and repertoire that has been passed from musician to musician, in some cases over many centuries.  Though rapid cultural change since the ‘50s has led to these sounds becoming scarce in their home territory, they never fully disappeared--thanks to the elders and past generations that lovingly and tenaciously carried them forward, renewing the voice of their musical ancestors at each step into changing circumstances.  The musicians of Lone Piñon learned from elder musicians who instilled in them a respect for continuity and an example of the radicalism, creativity, and cross-cultural solidarity that has always been necessary for musical traditions to adapt and thrive in each generation.  In 2014, Lone Piñon was founded as a platform for creativity around the oldest sounds of traditional New Mexico string music, sounds that had all but disappeared from daily life in many Northern New Mexico communities.  Through relationship with elders, study of field recordings, connections to parallel traditional music and dance revitalization movements in the US and Mexico, and hundreds of local and national performances, they have brought the language of the New Mexico orquesta típica back onto the modern stage, back onto dance floors, into a contemporary aesthetic/artistic conversation, and into the ears of a young generation.  The musical landscape of Northern New Mexico bears the record of interconnecting musical movements that cross state, national, generational, and ethnic borders. Lone Piñon’s active and recorded repertoire reflects that complexity, and has included a wide range of regionally-relevant material (Western swing, conjunto, New Mexican Spanish and Mexican ranchera, Central Mexican son regional, country, onda chicana, etc.) around the core New Mexican violin and accordion-driven polkas, cunas, inditas, valses, and chotes learned from elders.",

The band's name, translates as \"the state of musical intoxication,\" capturing the essence of this hyper-folk jam band. Formed in 2009 in Peshawar, Pakistan as an instrumental quartet, Khumariyaan emerged during a tumultuous period marked by Talibanization, sectarian violence, military operations, and neo- imperialist expansions. In such a climate, art, including music, served as a form of resistance. In the intervening decade, Khumariyaan has expanded its repertory of culturally rooted music, and, in 2024, welcomed a vocalist (and third guitarist) into the mix. Hospitality is central to Pushtoon culture; Khumariyaan welcomes all under its expansive, potent, and intoxicating musical tent.  With its propulsive, furious sound, Khumariyaan, \"The Intoxicators,\" has reawakened the live music scene in Peshawar, the ancient crossroads through the Khyber Pass that links Pakistan and Afghanistan. The lute-like Pashto rubab is the meeting point for this transfixing, hyper-folk quintet that intertwines the djembe-like zerbaghali (clay or wooden goblet drum), sehtar (long-necked lute), and searching vocals underpinned with driving acoustic guitars. Khumariyaan’s rolling pulse and richly layered sound builds to frenzied intensity. It’s an addictive and accessible pleasure that has ushered in a new era for an eclipsed music.  “We are group of individuals that have come together as one soul to experience and share the trance that is live acoustic music. To us, music is the best sublimated form of art. In our journey, we hope to entice musical ‘goose bumps’, and become a moving philosophical experience.” – rubab player and band leader Farhan Bogra.  Khumariyaan began its journey in 2009 and made its US debut tour in 2014 as part of Center Stage. In the intervening decade they’ve shared their work in Europe, the Middle East, and in East Africa, spreading art like water on the fires of fundamentalism in all its forms.  Farhan Bogra, founder, plays various ethnic lutes including the rubab and sehtar. Sparlay Rawail plays Dhol and lead guitar. He has a background in studio art and architecture from the National Council of the Arts. Shiraz Khan specializes in percussion and plays the indigenous percussion instrument Zerbaghali. Aamer Shafiq plays rhythm guitar and leads the Attan dance with the band. Obaid Khan is lead vocalist and guitarist. He holds a master's degree in Anthropology.  Farhan Bogra – rabab and sehtar, band leader Sparlay Rawail – lead guitar and dhol Aamer Shafiq – rhythm guitar Shiraz Khan – percussion Obaid Khan - vocals  “ Khumariyaan’s extended tunes spill across the border between Pashtoon folk and jam-band rock. It’s a cool vibe with the extra merit of puncturing stereotypes .” – Boston Globe  Khumariyaan is on tour in the USA as part of Center Stage, an initiative of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs with funding provided by the U.S. Government.

      "title": "Pat McLaughlin and David Ferguson",
      "description": "Doors 8pm, Show 8:30pm $30 adv / $35 DOS   Pat McLaughlin  is a quintessential maverick, right down to his pointed shrugging off of all the moniker implies. The revered, if a bit enigmatic, singer, songwriter and guitarist has spent years honing his layered style. Dedicated only to the pursuit of a new groove or an old feeling, his songs rehash the sights and sounds of a reformed nomad with roots in Iowa, footprints in San Francisco, New Orleans and Chicago, and a home in Nashville.   McLaughlin's compositions have been recorded by a jaw-dropping array of artists including  John Prine, Taj Mahal, Dan Auerbach, Bonnie Raitt, Yola, Marcus King, The Bahamas, Phoebe Bridgers, Tanya Tucker, George Strait, Steve Wariner, Gary Allan, Alan Jackson, Josh Turner, Tricia Yearwood, Mandy Barnett, Sierra Hull, Sierra Ferrel, Don Williams, John Anderson, Robert Finley, Gibson Brothers, Brandi Carlile, Nanci Griffith, Jamie Hartford, Shawn Camp, Ricky Van Shelton, Robert Earl Keen, Britti, Early James, Brit Taylor, Boy Named Banjo, Ian Tyson, Eric Church, Hayes Carll, Rag’n’Bone Man, Shannon and the Clams, Traveling’ McCourys, Kim Ritchie, Dee White, Brett Eldridge, Kendall Marvell, Al Kooper, Subdudes, Tiny Town, The Brummies, Miles Kane, Aubrey Peeples, Vince Herman, Nat Myers, Nathaniel Rateliff, Kurt Vile, Delbert McClinton, Tim O’Brien, Lee Ann Womack, McKinley James, Matt Warren.  Gary Allan recorded Pat's \"Songs About Rain,\" and Josh Turner recorded “Firecracker,” securing yet two more BMI Country Awards for McLaughlin. An in-demand studio musician, Pat's guitar \"chunking\" finessed projects by Neil Diamond, Jamie Hartford, Rosanne Cash, Julie Roberts, Don Williams, Al Cooper, John Doe, Cowboy Jack Clement, Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys) and many more.  As further testament to McLaughlin's skill, Pat was called on to play acoustic guitar for the Rick Rubin produced Johnny Cash American recordings. Pat McLaughlin frequently finds himself working alongside legends. A regular collaborator of John Prine, Pat was a 2 time nominee at the 2018 Grammy awards for the songs “Summer’s End” and “Knockin’ on your Screen Door,” both recorded by John Prine. In 2019, he was once again a Grammy nominee for “Far Away Look,” written with Yola and Dan Auerbach. In 2020 Pat took home the Grammy for “I Remember Everything,” recorded by John Prine. Rolling Stone called McLaughlin \"a tasty, rootsy gem,\" while he prompted the Tennessean's Peter Cooper to spout poetry: \"Groove and soul, slink and stutter, groove and soul, wisdom and pain, groove and soul.\"  In 2006, McLaughlin released Horsefly, again featuring the co-production credits of McLaughlin and Kenny Greenberg.  Loose but focused, the tracks ebb and flow seamlessly, offering wry observations on life's satisfactions and misfires. Melancholy honey and sweet desperation swap stories, while unadulterated happiness sweeps in as well.  Today, McLaughlin finds himself immersed in the Nashville songwriting scene. However, the true magic happens when Pat regularly brings down the house playing live gigs with his jaw dropping band, “The Men In My Life” (Kenny Greenberg, Steve Mackie, and Greg Morrow). \"No one since Dan Penn has better mixed '60s soul idioms with country music sentiment,\" proclaimed the Chicago Sun-Times. \"Pat McLaughlin is an American treasure.\"  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- With a music career spanning more than 40 years,  David Ferguson  has engineered landmark albums for Johnny Cash, opened a recording studio with John Prine, and shared a Grammy win with Sturgill Simpson. Now the Nashville native has become a compelling recording artist in his own right with  Nashville No More , his debut album on Fat Possum Records.  The self-produced project gathers an exceptional cast of friends from the city’s Americana and bluegrass community, while the track listing is simply a reflection of songs he likes. Some selections are familiar, but others are landing on a record for the first time. And even though Ferguson (better known around town as “Fergie”) says he recorded these songs as a way to pass the time during the pandemic, Nashville No More nonetheless carries him out of the control room and into a deserving spotlight.  “I always knew I was going to be in this business, always,” he says. “I think I knew I was going to be a recording engineer when I was about 15 years old. I've loved music all my life, but I never really listened to the lyrics of a song until I was in my 20s. I was just listening to the music, the whole thing. I guess I started noticing lyrics in my mid-20s, trying to figure out what a good song was then.”  That revelation coincided with a dream gig working for the legendary producer “Cowboy” Jack Clement, who hired Ferguson as a teenager to run errands. Ferguson heard about the job from the owner of the Old-Time Picking Parlor, a long-forgotten club and guitar repair shop in downtown Nashville. He took the job without knowing about Clement’s crucial role in establishing artists like Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, and Charley Pride. He stayed on for decades, engineering and producing records for newcomers and icons alike.  “I loved it. That was the best job in the world,” Ferguson says now. “A really good job for a young guy with very little education. ‘Cowboy’ gave me a chance.”  Those professional relationships followed him to his own Music Row studio called the Naughty Pines, a small, rented room where he produced demos and kept the door open for Cash, who liked to stretch out on the small couch. In the late ‘90s and early 2000s, Cash enlisted Ferguson (with producer Rick Rubin’s blessing) to engineer multiple sessions for the American Recordings series of albums, capturing modern classics like “Hurt” and “The Mercy Seat.”  John Prine, whom Ferguson remembers as “a great hang,” was another regular presence at the Naughty Pines. But when an adjoining tenant constantly complained about all the cigarette smoke, Fergie had no choice but to relocate. So, he and Prine launched a new studio they named the Butcher Shoppe, due to its unassuming location next to a former meat processing plant.  Many prominent Americana artists recorded there, including Tyler Childers, Margo Price and Sturgill Simpson. Fergie picked up a Grammy when Simpson’s A Sailor’s Guide to Earth – recorded at theButcher Shoppe -- won the 2016 Grammy for Best Country Album. But once the entire property was sold in 2020, the Butcher Shoppe became yet another casualty of the New Nashville. “We were there for a long time, about 15 years, and it was nice to have,” he says. “All good things come to an end.”  Not to be deterred, Fergie moved all of his recording equipment to his home studio, located on an acreage far from the city limits, and started cutting songs.   He recorded two of the tracks years ago, after singing them at a wedding. Others are by steadfast songwriters such as Guy Clark, Stephen Foster, Lee Hazlewood, Gordon Lightfoot, and Ian Tyson. Notable Nashville songwriters like Roger Cook, Pat McLaughlin, and Allen Reynolds are represented as well, with a pair of songs from his late friend,  Charles Cochran.  Throughout the album, Ferguson’s baritone conveys sincerity, not to mention life experience. The timbre of his vocal is believable whether he’s singing the wistful “Four Strong Winds,” or a love song like “Nights With You.” Meanwhile, the irresistible “Chardonnay” could have been a huge hit for Dean Martin back in the day, just as “Knockin’ Around Nashville” will satisfy longtime country listeners who still miss the piano and pedal steel.    Nashville No More  also stands as a testament to Fergie’s love for bluegrass music, particularly on “Early Morning Rain.” He lights up when remembering the two years he played bass during the final stretch of Jimmy Martin’s career. In addition, Ferguson won a 2013 Grammy for Best Bluegrass Album as an engineer on the Del McCoury Band’s  The Streets of Baltimore .  Bluegrass listeners will easily pick out the all-stars in the credits of Nashville No More: Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, Béla Fleck, Sierra Hull, Ronnie McCoury, Justin Moses, and Tim O’Brien, to name only a few. Will Oldham guests on “Fellow Travelers” and “Looking for You,” while Hull and Price sing exquisite harmony on multiple songs. Ferguson shares guitar duties with players like Dan Auerbach, Mark Howard, Billy Sanford, and Kenny Vaughan.   Nashville No More  brings a long-held family dream to fruition, too. Ferguson’s maternal grandfather moved to Nashville in the 1950s to be a singer and bandleader. But he put his musical ambitions on hold to help his daughter raise her children, including Fergie. Indeed, some of Ferguson’s earliest memories are being cradled in the family’s rocking chair, hearing his mother sing – and it’s fair to say that he’s been drawn to special voices ever since.",

From the folk revival through the golden age of country music, deafened by punk shows and brass bands alike, Chris’s songwriting is a nod to the absurd yet muted brilliance that inhabits the molded corners of the bars he patrons and cratered street he treads, paired with a pained honesty that merits a long second look.",

Throughout nearly three decades of releasing music and touring with the band, Roberge has enjoyed scaled down, personal acoustic performances in which he can stretch out and tell the stories that give life to the songs.  A  Stephen Kellogg  performance is like watching Ted Lasso live. Whether he’s playing music or doing stand-up, his shows leave people inspired and restored. For more than two decades, this wordsmith, Tedx speaker, stand- up comic, author and troubadour, has delighted audiences around the world. Planet Bluegrass calls him “a first class songwriter with a poet's gift for fresh imagery,” and Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz says of Kellogg, “there are few people in rock n’ roll who are just so great.” He has received the Armed Forces Entertainer of the Year award and has had his work nominated for a Grammy. Rolling Stone magazine describes his sound as “John Prine fronting the Heartbreakers.” The recent “Sit Down &amp; Stand Up” Tour was a one man show that opened to rave reviews from fans and critics alike, culminating in a two-night filming for a forthcoming one-hour comedy special. A mix of music, humor and storytelling, each performance paints a unique canvas that covers the full spectrum of human emotions. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll go home with a full heart.",

These touring and recording projects allowed him to share stages and recordings with Johnny Cash, Ali Farka Touré, V. M. Bhatt, Steve Earle, John Lee Hooker, Dr. John, Nick Lowe, and most notably the award winning project The Buena Vista Social Club.  Joachim discovered the joys of playing an electric mbira through a small amp, and the sound that emanated was inspired by the world music that always captivated him, “I’m always hearing some sort of defunct cosmic ice cream truck in my head – that’s the sound I’m after with my mbiras and tank drums and other tuned percussion.\"  In 2020 Nonesuch Records released Over That Road I’m Bound, the songs of Uncle Dave Macon and Joachim’s unique and celebrated re-imagining of these early country songs and earning Joachim #1 Most Added at Americana, and a Top 10 Album &amp; Single (US &amp; UK).

      "description": "Doors 8pm, Show 8:30pm  Michael Daves and Jacob Jolliff are two of America’s premier bluegrass talents. After years of collaborating in various bands and informal settings they have teamed up as a formidable duo featuring high lonesome vocal harmony and fiery flatpicking. Their sound is an homage to the classic guitar-mandolin “brother duets” while leaving plenty of room for improvisation and inspired left turns. They effortlessly straddle the line between hard-core traditional bluegrass and experimental forms.   Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Michael Daves grew up playing bluegrass in the grand old tradition of staying up late &amp; singing loud. Although he’s since moved north, the Southern roots permeate his music, however traditional or experimental.  Heralded as “a leading light of the New York bluegrass scene” by the New York Times, Daves has garnered attention for his work with Chris Thile, Steve Martin, Tony Trischka, Bruce Molsky and others in addition to his solo performances. His album “Sleep With One Eye Open” with Thile earned a 2011 Grammy nomination. Daves is also one of the most experienced instructors in bluegrass music, with a vocal school on ArtistWorks, presentations at many festivals, camps, and institutions including Carnegie Hall, and a private studio going back to the mid- 1990s.   Jacob Jolliff has become one of the country's most notable contemporary mandolinists. He was a member of the beloved New England roots band Joy Kills Sorrow, while attending Berklee School of Music on a full scholarship. In 2012, Jolliff won the National Mandolin Championship in Winfield, KS. Now a fixture of the national bluegrass community, he has collaborated and shared the stage with Darol Anger, Sam Bush, Ronnie McCoury, Jerry Douglas, Tony Trischka, and David Grisman among others. When Joy Kills Sorrow disbanded in 2014, Jolliff got the call to join Yonder Mountain String Band with whom he toured full time through 2019. In 2022 Jolliff released a self-titled Jacob Jolliff Band album and toured with Béla Fleck as part of My Bluegrass Heart.  Photo credit: Aidan Grant",
