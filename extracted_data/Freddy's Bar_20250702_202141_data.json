      "description": "Scott Stein is a Brooklyn-based pianist, songwriter, and sought-after collaborator and sideman, appearing with a diverse array of artists including Andi Rae Healy, Constantine Maroulis and Brooke Moriber. As a solo artist, his plain-spoken vocal delivery calls to mind Paul Simon's everyman-poet while his piano chops have garnered comparisons to Bruce Hornsby and Elton John. His latest EP Uphill is a song cycle about grief, loss, and coming out on the other side; the songs take a moodier turn as synthesizers swirl and backwards guitars fade in and out like ghosts. Melodies and sly musicianship still form the songs' backbone (think Ben Folds and Sting channeling Big Star's Third).www.scottsteinmusic.com, www.instagram.com/scottsteinmusic"

      "description": "Scott Mickelson is an artist/producer from San Francisco. His debut release Flickering was on the Grammy ballot for Best Folk Album and Best Roots Music Performance. His follow up full-length A Wondrous Life received great reviews in the US and abroad which led to his first European tour in 2019. He then produced the critically acclaimed Blanket The Homeless benefit compilation which included Grammy winner Fantastic Negrito. In 2020, Mickelson released Drowning In An Inflatable Pool to rave reviews in the U.S. and Europe. The first single, “Jagged Tooth” was accompanied by the fantastic animated video. In 2022, his single/video “UNarmed American” premiered on Americana U.K. and he was invited to play three nights at The Mavericks Festival in England. In 2022, the band released “Only Grey Matter Boiling In My Head” which included the XTC’s Colin Moulding on bass. His latest full-length If You Can't Be Right, Be Loud. (Feb 15, 2025) has been extremely well received with festivals and tours booking throughout the year. The five piece-band lives in Swindon, England. Mickelson continues to perform in the US, UK, Australia, Europe and Japan.http://www.mickelsonmusic.com https://www.facebook.com/mickelsonmusic https://www.instagram.com/scottmickelson/ https://www.youtube.com/user/scottmickelson https://www.tiktok.com/@mickelsonmusic"

As a solo artist, his plain-spoken vocal delivery calls to mind Paul Simon's everyman-poet while his piano chops have garnered comparisons to Bruce Hornsby and Elton John. His latest EP Uphill is a song cycle about grief, loss, and coming out on the other side; the songs take a moodier turn as synthesizers swirl and backwards guitars fade in and out like ghosts. Melodies and sly musicianship still form the songs' backbone (think Ben Folds and Sting channeling Big Star's Third).www.scottsteinmusic.com, www.instagram.com/scottsteinmusic",

His follow up full-length A Wondrous Life received great reviews in the US and abroad which led to his first European tour in 2019. He then produced the critically acclaimed Blanket The Homeless benefit compilation which included Grammy winner Fantastic Negrito. In 2020, Mickelson released Drowning In An Inflatable Pool to rave reviews in the U.S. and Europe. The first single, “Jagged Tooth” was accompanied by the fantastic animated video. In 2022, his single/video “UNarmed American” premiered on Americana U.K. and he was invited to play three nights at The Mavericks Festival in England. In 2022, the band released “Only Grey Matter Boiling In My Head” which included the XTC’s Colin Moulding on bass. His latest full-length If You Can't Be Right, Be Loud. (Feb 15, 2025) has been extremely well received with festivals and tours booking throughout the year. The five piece-band lives in Swindon, England. Mickelson continues to perform in the US, UK, Australia, Europe and Japan.http://www.mickelsonmusic.com https://www.facebook.com/mickelsonmusic https://www.instagram.com/scottmickelson/ https://www.youtube.com/user/scottmickelson https://www.tiktok.com/@mickelsonmusic",
