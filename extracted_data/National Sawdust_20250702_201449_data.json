      "description": "Nina Keith and Rachika Nayar were drawn to one another like mirror images or two sisters reuniting after a lifetime of separation. Four years ago, the artists met in Brooklyn's two-block–by–two-block Maria Hernandez Park after fan-girling each other’s music online. Dishing about messy post-lockdown long-distance lesbianism, heartfelt investments in Buddhist and Hindu philosophies, and a shared high-school love of the Eternal Sunshine OST, the two found their surface similarities gesturing toward a deeper shared existential worldview. Presented in partnership with AdHoc."

      "description": "After spending the majority of his adult life thus far in New York, Juan Wauters decides to revisit his native Montevideo, the culturally rich capital of Uruguay. Wauters explored the excitement of falling back in love with his birthplace on his subsequent record, 2023’s Wandering Rebel, but on his seventh studio album MVD LUV — due June 27 via Captured Tracks — Wauters doesn’t just introduce listeners to Montevideo; he invites them to feel at home within it. Having spent much of his career in the United States, Wauters has long carried the dual identity of immigrant and native son. With MVD LUV, a love letter to both his roots and his present, he set out to bridge those worlds by capturing the essence of Montevideo’s streets and communal spirit."
